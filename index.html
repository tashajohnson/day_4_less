				<p>Basically I'm pretty neat. I have hair. I like to pretend that I know what I am doing. This website is a perfect example of that penchant. I always carry a bandaid in my wallet because one day my brother in law cut his finger and everyone looked at me since I am a nurse. I was unprepared. I like mints and libraries. You should be my friend.</p>
				<p>I learned how to surf when I lived by Pearl Harbor. I was almost run over by a motercycle in Bangkok Thailand. I blew out my right eardrum scuba diving in Okinawa. I married my Senior Prom date. True story.</p>
				<p>Math is awesome. Yoga makes you smart. Google provides meditation classes to their employees to help them develop "Emotional Intelligence" which they found is desirable to make you successful as a techie.</p>
